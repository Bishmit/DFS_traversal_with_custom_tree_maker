# Custom Graph Traversal Simulator

[Download the demo video](https://github.com/Bishmit/DFS_traversal_with_custom_tree_maker/raw/master/Assets/Demo.mp4)

# Description
This is a dynamic graph traversal simulator built using SFML. It allows you to create graphs interactively and visualize DFS or BFS traversal dynamically.

# Prerequisites
- Install SFML on your PC from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php.

# How to Run
**Clone this repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/Bishmit/DFS_traversal_with_custom_tree_maker.git
```

- Ensure SFML is properly configured on your system
- Use your preferred C++ compiler, linking the necessary SFML libraries.
- Build the project from Visual studio

# Controls
- Press `C` to add a new circle (node).
- Left Click (Mouse) to drag a circle and move it around.
- Press `S` to snap two circles together, creating an edge between them.
- Press Left Shift + Left Click (Mouse) to traverse to the clicked node.

# Features
- Interactive Graph Creation: Add nodes, drag them, and connect them to form a graph.
- Real-Time Traversal Visualization: Choose DFS or BFS and see the traversal dynamically.
